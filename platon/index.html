<p>Adopted in 2013 at the EPFL library following a <q>librarian Pedro-to-librarian Marjorie</q> donation, Gundula passed away in June 2020 at the Rolex Learning Center.</p>
<p>The office shutdown combined with the heatwave got the better of you. Life is hard for a papyrus if it does not have water. The windows of the building are dangerous. Gundula resisted well, but without her librarian to water her, she withered and then dried up.</p>
<p>When she died, her librarian in charge wanted her to be buried in front of the library staff entrance so that she could rest where she lived for 7 years.</p>
<p>Farewell Gundula, your long green stems and your parasol leaves will be missed.</p>
